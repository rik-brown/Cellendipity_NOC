I need to decide on some rules

Larger radius = lower fertility
Larger radius = lower speed

Features that INCREASE likelihood of reproducing:
Large size
High fertility
High mobility (more likely to move to a space where other cells are located, but may also avoid other cells)

If using a steering behaviour: High strength of 'Seek' behaviour




Features that DECREASE likelihood of reproducing:
Small size
Low fertility
Low growth rate ? Takes a longer time to reach fertile state, but will remain fertile for longer

If using a steering behaviour: Low strength of 'Seek' behaviour
