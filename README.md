# Cellendipity_NOC

https://rik-brown.github.io/Cellendipity_NOC/

This is my submission for the Kadenze 'Nature of Code' course, assignment 05 - Genentic Algorithms.

My goals are:
1) to fully implement DNA for each cell object
2) to implement a 'crossover' function which combines two sets of DNA when parent cells collide & spawn a new cell
3) to implement a 'mutation' function to introduce random changes into the DNA of a new cell
